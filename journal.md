The cell phone ban was expected. Teachers used to always bicker at students about it so something was bound to happen. I don't really think it's going to change things that much. More than likely students are going to find ways to bother teachers more. So with that being said, the cell phone ban was beneficial for teachers because it diminishes the issue with students not paying attention, but some students who used it for educational use are now outlawed in school premises. That means that quizes using phones are now prohibited, students who relied on their phone to do school work are now also in trouble, so they need to stay on top of their belongings everyday. Students can't take pictures of notes and do them at home anymore so teachers have to provide notes through other means. While this may be easy it's also a new responsibility for the student to consistently check their gmail and google classroom for any announcements, updates, notes, assignments, etc. The phone ban has its ups and downs but overall it helps a lot of students in paying attention in class, so there's that.
