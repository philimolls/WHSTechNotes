A good AI project would be for farming. An AI farm is pretty creative in my eyes would be creative in terms of benefits to society and in mechanical processes it could do in order to farm productively. My idea meets the challenge requirements because the challenge wants Ai to be used reponsibly and ethically, and farming by AI is both ethical and reponsible because it provides resource to society. It could even probably be trained to detect product that is bad and rotten or filled with disease. That's why I think AI could be used reponsibly and ethically for farming. Not only that it can be extremely beneficial in multiple areas under the umbrella of farming.

I'm extremely interest in music. Music was something I was sub-conciously doing since I was 5. Singing was something I used to do everyday, humming the rhythyms and melodies I can get out my head. Music today, is easily accessible with many applications. I could even make my own software, it'd obviously take time but I could make one, or make a plugin for people to use. Computer science definitely ropes into music production, a TON considering it is quite literally, creating audio that sounds pleasing to the human ear. It takes skill to make a synthesizer, and it takes skill to master it.

The cell phone ban was expected. Teachers used to always bicker at students about it so something was bound to happen. I don't really think it's going to change things that much. More than likely students are going to find ways to bother teachers more. So with that being said, the cell phone ban was beneficial for teachers because it diminishes the issue with students not paying attention, but some students who used it for educational use are now outlawed in school premises. That means that quizes using phones are now prohibited, students who relied on their phone to do school work are now also in trouble, so they need to stay on top of their belongings everyday. Students can't take pictures of notes and do them at home anymore so teachers have to provide notes through other means. While this may be easy it's also a new responsibility for the student to consistently check their gmail and google classroom for any announcements, updates, notes, assignments, etc. The phone ban has its ups and downs but overall it helps a lot of students in paying attention in class, so there's that.
