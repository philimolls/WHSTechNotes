Techonology more than likely will never be used fairly. My views are usually pessimistic but overall the technology we have now only "Acts" until it's been too late. We can post about BLM, we can tweet about this and that, but in the eyes of the consumer they only look for an entertainer. The people who actually want equality are overshadowed by the people in power who silence them, and why does this work? Because people are too busy ranting about "brain rot" and the growing international disturbance that people from around the world are all thinking, "This might be WW3," it won't unless you truly believe it will. Furthermore, people care more about the general safety, rather than the safety of a specific minority, let's be honest a nuke looming over our heads wouldn't have people donating to the homeless. In the world of global communication and allbeit small but growing equality and justice for those who are colored, people as of yet, just don't care enough.

First things first, Happy New Year. I messed around over the break, making music and experimenting with different genres. The app, or more specifically DAW (Digital Audio-Workstation), was Bitwig. I've been using it for a few years now, but I think it's time I should get something new, like Abelton, but for the most part I made music, animated on blender a little bit, and messed around in roblox studio.

It was structured in a simple term, that allowed Canva wiggle in terms of creation of the quiz. Canva used the prompt I gave it in great terms, its curious because I thought it would've lacked in terms of creativity. Although my expectations were low it exceeded the low expectations. So, the most interactive parts about the quiz, were the few buttons on the screen, and the simple scoring. I could add maybe some graphic design, and watch it meticioulusly build it. But overall, Canva AI is not that bad in terms of quiz creation, in my eyes.

The phrase "6, 7" is a viral, senseless trend among students that came from a joke rap song. It has no real meaning, but its confusion is the point. Students use it as a kind of inside joke, often shouted in the hallways or whispered descreetly during class. Its usage builds a sense of familiarity and shared humor within their peer group. The repetitive, almost melodic, speech of the numbers is part of the fun. Ultimately, the phrase exists purely for the fun of being in on a joke adults don't understand.

A good AI project would be for farming. An AI farm is pretty creative in my eyes would be creative in terms of benefits to society and in mechanical processes it could do in order to farm productively. My idea meets the challenge requirements because the challenge wants Ai to be used reponsibly and ethically, and farming by AI is both ethical and reponsible because it provides resource to society. It could even probably be trained to detect product that is bad and rotten or filled with disease. That's why I think AI could be used reponsibly and ethically for farming. Not only that it can be extremely beneficial in multiple areas under the umbrella of farming.

I'm extremely interest in music. Music was something I was sub-conciously doing since I was 5. Singing was something I used to do everyday, humming the rhythyms and melodies I can get out my head. Music today, is easily accessible with many applications. I could even make my own software, it'd obviously take time but I could make one, or make a plugin for people to use. Computer science definitely ropes into music production, a TON considering it is quite literally, creating audio that sounds pleasing to the human ear. It takes skill to make a synthesizer, and it takes skill to master it.

The cell phone ban was expected. Teachers used to always bicker at students about it so something was bound to happen. I don't really think it's going to change things that much. More than likely students are going to find ways to bother teachers more. So with that being said, the cell phone ban was beneficial for teachers because it diminishes the issue with students not paying attention, but some students who used it for educational use are now outlawed in school premises. That means that quizes using phones are now prohibited, students who relied on their phone to do school work are now also in trouble, so they need to stay on top of their belongings everyday. Students can't take pictures of notes and do them at home anymore so teachers have to provide notes through other means. While this may be easy it's also a new responsibility for the student to consistently check their gmail and google classroom for any announcements, updates, notes, assignments, etc. The phone ban has its ups and downs but overall it helps a lot of students in paying attention in class, so there's that.
